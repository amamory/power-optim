# power-optim
Minizinc models of a power-aware task placement onto a heterogenous platform (.e.g, big-little, gpu, fpga).

## Setup 

```
$ sudo snap install minizinc
$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv
$ git clone https://github.com/amamory/power-optim.git
$ cd power-optim
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install --editable .
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Models

Browse the directories to try each model. The suggested order in terms of complexity:
 - `makespan`: jobs without precedence constraint;
 - `makespan-dag`: similar to the previous one but jobs have precedence constraints represented by a DAG;
 - `deadline-dag`: almost equal to the previous one, but it includes an additional deadline constraint;
 - `deadline-power`: while the previous one minimizes the makespan, this one minizes the power as long as the deadline is respected;
 - `affinity`: this model is built on top of the previous one, but adding affinity constraint;
 - `pu-utilization`: this model is built on top of the previous one, but including *task period* and *processing unit utilization* constraint. **TODO**.
