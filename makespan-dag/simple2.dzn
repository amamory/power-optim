% tiny instance for the model that minimizes the makespan precedence constraint.
% Same DAG used in simple.dzn, but with different job durations.
% This case shows the optimization for heterogeneous since we can see that: 
% 1) j1 and j2 are run in C1 instead of running both in parallel even considering that 
% the precedence would allow running them in parallel.
% 2) similarly, j3 and j4 could be both run in parallel w duration 2 for each job 
% or run sequentially w duration 1 for each job
